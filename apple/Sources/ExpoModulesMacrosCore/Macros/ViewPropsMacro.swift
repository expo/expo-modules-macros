/// Member + extension macro applied to a view-props type. Like `@Record`, **every stored property**
/// that is not `static`, `private`, `fileprivate`, `lazy` or computed is part of the surface — no
/// `@Field` wrapper — but unlike a record, the properties split into two kinds by their type:
///
/// - a **function-typed** property is an **event** (`var onTap: (TapEvent) -> Void`), dispatched by
///   name through the view's event emitter. No JS function object is ever decoded into it.
/// - every other property is a **value prop**, decoded from the raw props Fabric delivers.
///
/// An event must be spelled as a function type. The macro reads only the syntax, so a closure type
/// behind a typealias (`var onTap: TapHandler`) is a value prop.
///
/// Core creates the props with `Self()` and resets a prop that React removes (sends as `null`) to its
/// value there, so every value prop is a `var` with a default. When the type declares its own
/// `init()`, that initializer sets the defaults, and the compiler checks that it sets every stored
/// property. Otherwise each stored value prop needs an initial value, or a type written as `T?` or
/// `T!`, which defaults to `nil` (`Optional<T>` doesn't), and so does each `private` or `fileprivate`
/// stored property, which isn't a prop. The author's `init()` must be non-failable, non-throwing and
/// synchronous, so that core can call it.
///
/// The macro synthesizes the identity surface the batched reaction model reads:
///
/// - `PropName`: a `String`-backed `CaseIterable` enum, one case per value prop, whose raw value is
///   the wire key. It doubles as the string → prop translation table, so the runtime maps a raw
///   changed key with `PropName(rawValue:)` and names a prop in a log with `prop.rawValue`.
/// - `PropSet`: an `OptionSet` over `UInt64`, one bit per value prop in declaration order. This is the
///   membership currency: the changed set on a diff is a bitmask, so asking what changed costs no
///   allocation and no hashing.
/// - `_eventNames`: the event props' names, verbatim, for core to register at view creation.
/// - `typealias Diff = PropsDiff<Self>`, the nested spelling of core's one generic diff.
/// - a public `init()`, which `AnyViewProps` requires, when Swift's own can't satisfy it: when an
///   event prop has no initial value, when the type is `public` or `package` (Swift's `init()` is
///   `internal`), also through a `public` or `package` extension that contains it, or when the type
///   declares other initializers (Swift then synthesizes no `init()`). It gives each
///   event without an initial value an empty closure (`{}`, `{ _ in }`, ...) and leaves the value
///   props at their initial values. It is never generated when the type declares its own `init()`.
///   Like any initializer in the struct body, the generated one removes the memberwise initializer.
/// - `_resetViewProp(_:in:)`: sets one value prop back to its default, by assigning the property's
///   initial value or `nil`, so a reset evaluates only that prop's default. It is a static member of
///   the struct body, because an initial value can name a static member without `Self.` or a member of
///   an enclosing type, which an instance method or the extension can't.
///
/// An event's function type must return `Void`, because JavaScript can't return a value to it.
///
/// The extension that conforms the type to `AnyViewProps` adds:
///
/// - `allProps`: every bit set, the changed set on the first application.
/// - `propSet(for:)`: one name's bit, for folding raw changed keys into the mask.
/// - `_decode(_:from:in:)`: assigns one value prop from a JavaScript value. `null` and `undefined`
///   reset it with `_resetViewProp(_:in:)`, and any other value decodes through
///   `JavaScriptDecodable`.
///
/// `_decode` and `_resetViewProp` run on the JavaScript actor. The other generated types and members
/// and the conformance are `nonisolated`, so core can use them on any thread also when the module
/// builds with a default isolation, such as `-default-isolation MainActor`. The props' own
/// declarations still take that isolation, so a struct with an event prop, a value prop whose type
/// isn't `Sendable`, or a computed prop needs `nonisolated` on its declaration, and the author's
/// `init()` must be `nonisolated` too. So must a conformance that the author declares
/// (`: nonisolated AnyViewProps`).
///
/// Author-facing shape — no conformance to spell out:
///
///   @ViewProps
///   struct CardProps {
///     var color: UIColor = .red        // value prop, bit 0
///     var radius: CGFloat = 0          // value prop, bit 1
///     var onTap: (TapEvent) -> Void    // event, no bit
///   }
///
/// The diff type itself is deliberately **not** generated. Core's generic
/// `PropsDiff<Props: AnyViewProps>` owns both storage (`old`/`new`/`changedProps`) and behavior
/// (`changed(_:)`, `oldValue(_:)`, `isInitial`, `changedNames`), reaching the per-props types through
/// the conformance's associated types — so the query API can grow without a macro release.
///
/// Event names are emitted **verbatim**, with no `on`-prefix stripping. This differs from `@Event` on
/// modules and shared objects, which strips it (`onStatusChange` → `"statusChange"`): a view event prop
/// is a React prop name that Fabric carries as-is, so the native and JS spellings must match exactly.
